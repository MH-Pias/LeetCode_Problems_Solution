We can use BFS to determine whether we can reach the index with a value of 0 .

Define a queue q to store the currently reachable indices. Initially, enqueue the s t a r t index.

When the queue is not empty, take out the front index i of the queue. If a r r [ i ] = 0 , return true. Otherwise, mark the index i as visited. If i + a r r [ i ] and i âˆ’ a r r [ i ] are within the array range and have not been visited, enqueue them and continue searching.

Finally, if the queue is empty, it means that we cannot reach the index with a value of 0 , so return false.

The time complexity is O ( n ) , and the space complexity is O ( n ) . Where n is the length of the array.
